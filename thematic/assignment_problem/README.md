## Environment
To run `comparison.py`, I used Python3.10.

The required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt` and could be installed in the command line by
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

As usual, better install them in a virtual environment instead of in the system Python of your machine.


## TODO
`comparison.py`
1. [ ] Add flag to max/min the problem
1. [x] Add solution using PuLP
1. [ ] 


## Q&A
1. The Hungarian algorithm feels sophisticated. Is there anything which assured Mr. Kuhn of its success, before his
   diving into designing such complex algorithm? I mean, it will be a huge waste if, after much struggling and
   effort, we end up with a solution with the same worst-case complexity of $O(n!)$.
