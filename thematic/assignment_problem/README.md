## Q&A
1. The Hungarian algorithm feels sophisticated. Is there anything which assured Mr. Kuhn of its success, before his
   diving into designing such complex algorithm? I mean, it will be a huge waste if, after much struggling and
   effort, we end up with a solution with the same worst complexity of $O(n!)$.
