1. (p. 33) Step A seems unnecessary because by definition matrix $A$'s smallest element is already $0$:
   $$x_{i,j} = \max_{p,q} r_{p,q} - r_{i,j}$$
1. (p. 33) Step B.
    - How is the minimal set $S\_{1}$ defined? I think, it can be defined as follows.  
      Since the matrix $A$ is $n$ by $n$, the set of all $2n$ lines is a set containing all the zeros of $A$.  
      A set $S$ is said to be minimal of all such sets if, given another such set $S'$, we have $m \le m'$,
      where $m, m'$ denotes the cardinal numbers of $S, S'$, resp.
    - Explain the statement
      > If $n_{1} = n$, there is a set of $n$ independent zeros.
      
      Explanation:<br>
      Assume that $n_{1} = n$ and that $A$ contains $m \le n$ independent zeros.
      By KÅ‘nig's theorem (stated on p.32-33), there exists a set $S'$ of $m$ lines containing
      all the zeros. However, since $S_{1}$ is the smallest such set, we must have
      $$n_{1} = n \le m$$
1. (p. 33) Step D.<br>
   Let's denote by $\texttt{sum}(A)$ the sum of all elements of a matrix $A$.<br>
   Then the sequence $\texttt{sum}(A_{k})$ is a strictly decreasing (integer) sequence which is
   bounded below by $0$.<br>
   Indeed, if the procedure (of steps A,B,C,D) cannot terminate at $k$, then
   $$\texttt{sum}(A_{k+1}) = \texttt{sum}(A_{k}) - n^{2}\cdot h_{k} + n_{k}\cdot n\cdot h_{k} = \texttt{sum}(A_{k}) - n\cdot (n - n_{k})\cdot h_{k}$$
1. (p. 34) Step 2.<br>
    - > "Let $Z_{1}$ denote the $0^{\*}$ in $Z_{0}$'s column (if any)."
      
      Explanation:<br>
       - If we arrives at this sentence by coming straightfoward from step 1, then there should not exist such $Z_{1}$
         because $Z_{0}$ was primed exactly because it lied on an uncovered column.
       - If we arrives at this sentence after step 1 has uncovered and covered pairs of columns and rows,
         then it is possible that $Z_{0}$'s column is no longer covered, albeit containing a $0^{\*}$.
         We can then choose $Z_{1}$ to be this $0^{\*}$.
    - What is implicit in Munkres' words is that, when constructing the sequence of alternating starred and primed zeros,
       - when it comes to $0^{\*}$'s turn, there could or could not exist such $0^{\*}$; in case of absence, we simply
         arrives at the end of the sequence;
       - when it comes to $0^{'}$'s turn, there **always exists** a $0^{'}$.
