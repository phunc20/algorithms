## Clarifications
1. (p. 33) Step A seems unnecessary because by definition matrix $A$'s smallest element is already $0$:
   $$x_{i,j} = \max_{p,q} r_{p,q} - r_{i,j}$$
1. (p. 33) Step B.
    - How is the minimal set $S_{1}$ defined? I think, it can be defined as follows.<br>
      Since the matrix $A$ is $n$ by $n$, the set of all $2n$ lines is a set containing all the zeros of $A$.<br>
      A set $S$ is said to be minimal of all such sets if, given another such set $S'$, we have $n \le n'$,
      where $n, n'$ are the cardinal numbers of $S, S'$, resp.
