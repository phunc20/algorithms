Q: What does FIND-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY return when all elements of $A$ are negative?<br>
A: It simply returns the singleton array containing the maximum of $A.$

Indeed, any subarray must contain at least one element of the original array,
among which the previously mentioned one has the maximum sum.
Any subarray of length greater than or equal to $2$ must have
inferior sum since all elements of $A$ are negative.
