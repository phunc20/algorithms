I think the concept of a tree originates from **family tree**. (That's why we talk about _ancestor_,
_descendant_ in free tree theory.) As for the mathematical definition of a tree
(a _connected, acyclic, undirected_ graph), it was only conceived later; despite of its complexity,
it might be more accurate to define it as such.
